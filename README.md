# ToDo List Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The ToDo List project is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks. It provides features for adding, creating, editing, and deleting tasks. The project is divided into two main components:

- **Frontend (React.js):** This component handles the user interface and interactions. Users can view, add, edit, and delete tasks through the web interface.

- **Backend :** The backend component serves as the API to store and manage tasks. It handles HTTP requests from the frontend, communicates with a database, and sends back data to the frontend.
